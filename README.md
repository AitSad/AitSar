# AitSar
This library implements algorithms faster then the binary search algorithm, and is dedicated to Sir Nisar, from the BMI faculty. The module library can be imported as crate in rust by including this snippet in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```rust
[dependencies]
AitSar = "0.1.1"
```

## Usage

```rust
use AitSar::search::{ternary, hash, interpolation, fibonacci};
use AitSar::table::{hash};
```
